Feature: Test our app for path XSS vuln using arachni  

Background:
  Given "arachni" is installed
  And the following profile:
     | name       | value                            |
     | url        | http://164.52.194.21:8008/login  |

Scenario:  XSS path test login page
  When I launch an "arachni" attack with:
  """
  arachni --checks=xss_path --scope-page-limit=1 <url>
  """
  Then the output should contain "0 issues were detected."
